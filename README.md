# Putah-Creek-Water-Quality-Dashboard
This is the R Code to the Dashboard I created using the water quality data I was given by the UC Davis Arboretum. Within the dashboard there are summary 
statistics, a correlation plot, exploratory analysis visual graphs and the unsupervised machine learning method of hierarchal clustering to look for 
patterns between the locations in terms of water quality.
